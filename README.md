- make it work
- introduce pageobjects (should be 3 pages + basepage)
- refactor to cucumber that the feature file provided works (some renaming/reordering is fine,
 but the steps should be reusable)
- use dynamic waits instead of sleeps
- additional scenarios will be provided later
- include the younglings if possible
